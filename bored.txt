Ah
Ah
The games you played were never fun (mm)
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run (ah)
Givin' you what you're beggin' for
Givin' you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Givin' you what you're beggin' for
Givin' you what you say I need
Say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teachin' me to live without it
Bored
I'm so bored
I'm so bored
So bored
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where (mm)
I hope you don't think that shit's fair (ah)
Givin' you all you want and more
Givin' you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm gettin' bored?
Givin' you every piece of me
Piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teachin' me to live without it
Bored
I'm so bored
I'm so bored
So bored
Givin' you what you're beggin' for
Givin' you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Givin' you what you're beggin' for
Givin' you what you say I need
Say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teachin' me to live without it
